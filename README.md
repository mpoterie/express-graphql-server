This repository is the server of a project using GraphQL, Node, Express, MongoDB.

It is written in Javascript.

You will find the client side project [here][https://github.com/mpoterie/react-graphql-client]

The project is widely inspired by the GraphQl and React tutorial on Youtube, by The Net Ninja. Many parts of the code had to be updated (new API, new syntax, updated packages...), on both sides of the developping process.
